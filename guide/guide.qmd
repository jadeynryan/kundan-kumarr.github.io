## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive framework to prepare for **Research Scientist positions** in academia, industry research labs (FAANG, OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.), and national labs. It combines insights from my own experience, interviews, and conversations with hiring managers.

## Key Interview Components

### 1️⃣ **Research Portfolio Deep Dive**

- Be able to explain your **core research contributions** in detail.
- Clearly articulate: problem definition, novelty, methods, results, and real-world impact.
- Prepare multiple levels of technical depth (5-min, 15-min, 30-min versions).
- Practice connecting your work to broader research trends and applications.

### 2️⃣ **Technical Machine Learning Knowledge**

- Reinforcement Learning: algorithms, policy gradients, actor-critic, safe RL.
- Deep Learning: optimization, architecture design, generalization, transformers.
- Probabilistic Modeling: Bayesian inference, uncertainty estimation, graphical models.
- Generative Models: GANs, VAEs, diffusion models.
- Large Language Models: LLM scaling laws, prompting, fine-tuning, RAG architectures.
- Vision: object detection, segmentation, multi-modal perception.

### 3️⃣ **System Design / Applied ML Problems**

- Be able to discuss:
  - End-to-end ML pipelines
  - Data challenges (imbalance, noisy labels, drift)
  - Model serving and deployment challenges
  - Scalability, latency, interpretability

### 4️⃣ **Coding and Algorithmic Skills**

- Leetcode-style DSA for research interviews (moderate level)
- Data manipulation (pandas, numpy, SQL)
- Model prototyping (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX)

### 5️⃣ **Behavioral and Collaboration Skills**

- "Tell me about a time..." questions.
- Collaboration across teams.
- Handling ambiguous open-ended research problems.
- Communication with product teams or non-research stakeholders.

## Recommended Preparation Resources

- **Papers**: Read papers from top-tier conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ACL).
- **Coding**: Leetcode (medium), ML system design problems.
- **System Design**: Read “Designing Machine Learning Systems” by Chip Huyen.
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice mock sessions with peers or mentors.
- **Presentation**: Prepare 1-2 strong 20-minute research talks.

---

## Example Interview Questions

- How does your research contribute to state-of-the-art methods?
- Walk me through one of your recent papers.
- How would you apply your methods to X domain?
- What challenges remain in your area of research?
- How do you evaluate safety, robustness, or uncertainty in your models?
- How would you adapt your methods if labeled data was extremely limited?

---

## My Personal Advice

- **Clarity beats complexity** — explain ideas simply.
- Be enthusiastic about your work and its impact.
- Connect your strengths to the job’s mission.
- Show your ability to collaborate and iterate.
