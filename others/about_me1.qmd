I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) with a minor in [Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), under the guidance of [Dr. Ravikumar Gelli](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/gelli/) and [Dr. Christopher Quinn](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/christopher-quinn). My research focuses on developing intelligent, secure, and adaptable AI systems for smart energy applications. I explore a broad range of methodologies, including **single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning (DRL)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **graphical models**, and **adversarial robustness**, to enhance the control, resilience, and adaptability of cyber-physical infrastructure.

At the core of my work is the application of **physics-informed reinforcement learning**, where domain-specific constraints are embedded directly into the learning process to ensure safety, interpretability, and compliance with real-world systems. I design and evaluate AI systems capable of operating under uncertainty, detecting adversarial behavior, and making reliable decisions in dynamic environments. My research on adversarial robustness aims to strengthen the security of AI agents against manipulation, supporting safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

To support cross-domain generalization, I develop **transfer learning techniques** that allow reinforcement learning agents to adapt across diverse topologies, environmental dynamics, and operational conditions. I also lead the design of a **Python-based control and simulation framework**, integrating real-time co-simulation platforms like **OpenDSS**, enabling rapid development, testing, and validation of intelligent control algorithms in realistic smart energy settings.

Beyond smart energy systems, I maintain active research interests in **probabilistic reasoning**, **statistical machine learning**, and **robotics**, as well as the integration of **LLMs** with simulation and control frameworks. I am particularly excited about the potential of LLMs to improve human-AI interaction, enhance contextual awareness, and drive more interpretable and adaptive behavior in intelligent systems.

## Hi there!

I am a researcher focused on developing intelligent, secure, and adaptable AI systems for next-generation cyber-physical infrastructure. My work spans **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)**, **multi-agent systems**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **safe and explainable AI**, **computer vision**, and **robotics**, with real-world applications in smart energy systems, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.

The core of my Ph.D. research centers on developing **physics-informed and safety-critical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks** that embed domain knowledge and system constraints directly into the learning process. By incorporating physical laws, safety boundaries, and system dynamics into policy optimization, I design agents capable of making robust, interpretable, and reliable decisions in dynamic, high-stakes environments. My work addresses challenges such as **uncertainty quantification**, **adversarial resilience**, and **safe exploration**, while enabling agents to generalize across diverse network topologies, environmental conditions, and task distributions through advanced **transfer learning** and **meta-learning** techniques.

I also leverage the **CARLA simulator** for autonomous driving research, combining computer vision, trajectory planning, and policy learning in complex traffic environments. My work integrates **vision-based perception models** for object detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion, enabling robust situational awareness for autonomous agents. In parallel, I integrate **LLM-based reasoning** into simulation and control frameworks to support high-level planning, adaptive decision-making, and interactive human-AI collaboration for robotics and safety-critical control.

Beyond autonomous and energy systems, my broader research interests include **probabilistic modeling**, **statistical machine learning**, and developing AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and deployable in real-world complex environments.


**Other Research Interests:**

- **Computer Vision:** Visual perception, object detection, semantic segmentation, sensor fusion for autonomous systems.
- **Software Systems:** Scalable software engineering, simulation framework development, real-time systems integration.
- **Statistical Machine Learning:** Uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, data-driven inference in dynamic environments.
- **Robotics:** Learning-based control, adaptive planning, safe human-robot interaction, multi-modal robotic systems.
