i! I'm <strong style="color:#007bff;">Kundan Kumar</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate and researcher focused on building intelligent, secure, and adaptable AI systems for next-generation cyber-physical infrastructure. My work bridges deep reinforcement learning (DRL), multi-agent systems, large language models (LLMs), safe and explainable AI, and computer vision, with real-world applications in smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.

My Ph.D. research centers on physics-informed and safety-critical DRL frameworks that embed domain knowledge, safety constraints, and uncertainty into the learning processâ€”enabling agents to make robust and interpretable decisions in dynamic, complex environments. My research within DRL focuses on techniques such as transfer learning, uncertainty quantification, and adversarial resilience to improve generalization, safety, and reliability across diverse tasks and environments.

I also develop LLM-integrated simulation frameworks for robotics and autonomous systems, combining vision-based perception, trajectory planning, and natural language reasoning to support high-level control and human-AI collaboration.

Beyond research, I enjoy sharing my insights through educational content on [Substack](https://neuravp.substack.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AIAgentic-007/). Outside of work, I love cooking and Ice skating ðŸ›¼.
