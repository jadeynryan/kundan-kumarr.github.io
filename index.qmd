::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! 

I am a researcher and Ph.D. candidate developing **Safe Reinforcement Learning, Vision-based Simulation, and Large Language Models (LLMs)** for real-world autonomous systems and critical infrastructure. My work combines **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)**, **physics-informed AI**, and **safe control** to build robust AI agents for smart energy systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

In 2024, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Internship at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), where I developed a Bayesian Semi supervised algorithm for phase identification using small, limited, and unreliable datasets. This work has been accepted for presentation at the [PES-GM 2025 Conference](https://pes-gm.org/). 

In my spare time, I also create educational content simplifying **AI, ML, and statistics**, sharing insights on [Substack](https://neuravp.substack.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AIAgentic-007/).

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and skating.
