::: {#hero-heading}

Hello!

I'm **Kundan Kumar** â€” a Ph.D. candidate and researcher building **safe and trustworthy AI systems** for real-world autonomous applications. My research integrates **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)**, **physics-informed AI**, and **safe control** to create robust agents for smart energy systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

In 2024, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer Intern** at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/), where I designed a **Bayesian semi-supervised learning algorithm** for phase identification on small, limited, and unreliable datasets. This work will be presented at the **[IEEE PES General Meeting 2025](https://pes-gm.org/)**.

I'm passionate about democratizing AI knowledge. I create educational content simplifying **AI, ML, and statistics** on [Substack](https://neuravp.substack.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AIAgentic-007/).

Outside of research, I enjoy **cooking** and **skating**. ðŸ›¼
