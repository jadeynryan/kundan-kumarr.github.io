As a Teaching Assistant at Iowa State University, I am dedicated to creating an inclusive and dynamic learning environment that enables students to excel in computer science. My teaching approach emphasizes practical application of theoretical concepts, encouraging students to develop hands-on experience in software development, user interface design, and database management. I believe in preparing students for real-world challenges in the technology industry through project-based learning and personalized support.

**Courses I have served as a Teaching Assistant or Mentor in:**

<style>
/* Hide visually but keep in DOM so it appears in TOC */
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px; height: 1px;
  padding: 0; margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden; clip: rect(0,0,0,0);
  border: 0; white-space: nowrap;
}
</style>
<style>
/* --- Keep TOC items on one line (with ellipsis if needed) --- */
nav[role="doc-toc"] li > a,
nav[role="doc-toc"] li > a .nav-link-text {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  hyphens: none;
}

/* Optional: give the TOC a bit more room so fewer items truncate */
.sidebar nav[role="doc-toc"] {
  min-width: 18rem;   /* tweak to 19–20rem if you want more */
}
</style>

## Future Goals

I am committed to continually improving teaching methods and curriculum design. My goals include:

- Incorporating emerging AI and software development tools into teaching.
- Creating interactive, hands-on, project-based learning environments.
- Contributing to the computer science education community through curriculum research and mentoring.
- Expanding opportunities for students to apply theory to real-world computing challenges.
