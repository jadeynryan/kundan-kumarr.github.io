## COMS 3630 – Introduction to Database Management Systems
### 📘 Course Description

**COMS 3630** offers a comprehensive introduction to **database systems**, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students explore various data models (relational, object-oriented, and semistructured), learn **query languages** such as SQL and NoSQL, and build full-stack applications that integrate modern database backends with web interfaces.

The course emphasizes database **design**, **optimization**, and **application development**, using tools like MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J.

### 🧑‍🏫 My Role as Teaching Assistant

As a **Teaching Assistant** for COMS 3630, I supported over 100 students in understanding key database concepts and building end-to-end data-driven applications. My responsibilities included:

- **Lab Instruction & Demonstrations:** Led weekly sessions on topics like SQL programming, ER modeling, and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Neo4J).
- **Project Mentorship:** Guided students through semester-long projects, helping them design schemas, write efficient queries, and integrate databases with web applications.
- **Technical Support:** Assisted students in implementing transactions, managing storage, and debugging issues related to query execution and performance.
- **Design Review & Grading:** Evaluated assignments and database design submissions, providing constructive feedback aligned with best practices.
- **Office Hours:** Offered one-on-one and group-based academic support on database internals, relational algebra, and query optimization strategies.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Design and implement relational databases using **ER modeling and normalization** techniques.  
- Develop database-driven applications using **SQL**, **APIs**, and **ORM frameworks**.  
- Work with **NoSQL systems** including document-based (MongoDB) and graph-based (Neo4J) databases.  
- Understand the inner workings of a DBMS, including **query processing**, **transaction management**, and **storage optimization**.
