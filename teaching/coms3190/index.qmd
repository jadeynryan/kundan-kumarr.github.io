## COMS 3190 – User Interface Design

### 📘 Course Description

**COMS 3190** introduces students to the fundamentals of **user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** design through both theory and extensive hands-on development. The course covers **human-computer interaction (HCI)** concepts, front-end and back-end technologies, and the use of modern **frameworks and APIs** for developing web and Windows-based user interfaces.

Students gain experience with:

- UI design principles  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React, Node.js, Express  
- Databases (MongoDB and MySQL)  
- UML modeling and event-driven architecture  
- Web and desktop-based client/server applications

### 🧑‍🏫 My Role as Teaching Assistant

As a **Teaching Assistant** for COMS 3190, I supported over 100 students in learning full-stack web development principles within the context of UI/UX design. My key responsibilities included:

- **Technical Instruction:** Provided lab support and walkthroughs for building responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
- **Project Mentorship:** Guided students through semester-long UI/UX projects, including front-end development, API design, and database integration.
- **Design & Modeling Help:** Assisted students in using UML for system modeling and behavioral analysis, including use case and interaction diagrams.
- **Testing Support:** Supported unit testing and UI testing procedures in JavaScript and helped students debug their web applications.
- **Code Review & Feedback:** Reviewed student submissions and provided feedback on usability, design consistency, and code efficiency.
- **Office Hours:** Held weekly office hours to help students troubleshoot development issues and understand best practices in UI/UX design.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Upon completing the course, students are expected to:

- Design and implement interactive and accessible user interfaces.
- Apply principles of **HCI, UI design, UX testing**, and event-driven architecture.
- Use industry-standard tools to build and evaluate responsive, full-stack applications.
- Analyze and model system behavior using **UML and interaction diagrams**.
- Deploy and test applications with modern development environments and version control.
