## Abstract

The integration of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) into power distribution networks generates valuable data for tasks such as phase identification; however, the limited and unreliable availability of labeled data in the form of customer phase connectivity presents challenges. To address this issue, we propose a **semi-supervised learning (SSL)** framework that effectively leverages both **labeled and unlabeled data**.


## Contribution
Our approach incorporates:

- **Self-training** with an ensemble of multilayer perceptron classifiers.
- **Label spreading** to propagate labels based on data similarity.
- **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)** for **uncertainty estimation**, improving confidence and reducing phase identification errors.


**Key Highlights:**

- Achieved **~98% ± 0.08 accuracy** on real utility data (Duquesne Light Company) using minimal and unreliable labeled data.
- Uncertainty-aware predictions reduce misclassification risk and improve smart grid reliability.
- Combines **pseudo-labeling**, **graph-based SSL**, and **probabilistic modeling** to handle data scarcity in real-world distribution networks.

Our SSL + Uncertainty Estimation approach provides an efficient and scalable solution for **phase identification in AMI data**, enabling utilities to improve **modeling, simulation, and operational decision-making**.
