> I wrote a blog back in early 2023 when I first switched from blogdown to Quarto on my initial impression (read [here](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/blog_20230103_blogdown2quarto/)), and this is a two-year follow-up on my journey since I started using Quarto, for my personal website, teaching, scientific works and collaborative community projects. 

## Quarto as a teaching tool

### From personal to workshop website

I switched from blogdown to Quarto in late 2022, right after my PhD. It was initially a cure for a severe burnout from a combination of work-related stressors, when I desperately needed something other than research. My mental state was like the famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch:

The experience of the switch was explained in the previously mentioned blog. Briefly, it was light like a feather. Since I was quite satisfied, I thought, why don't I make a **workshop website**? So I did.

The result was quite good, I made the (as far as I knew) first quarto workshop [website](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/2022_bioinformatics_workshop/) at University of Oslo for the [Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2022](https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/events/oslo-bioinformatics-week-2022/). Feedback from students were positive, and the instructor team thought it hosts the material in a more organized way.

### Single day workshop -> two week course

I was greatly encouraged by the experience, so when I got a 50% position at University of Oslo as biostatistics lecturer, I thought, why don't we have the same thing for the course?

Oh well, the workload is crushing. There were a few key differences:

* R scripts and material were unavailable since the course was originally in STATA. Everything need to be done from scratch, for at least 12 lab sessions;
* The students generally have little IT skills, which means more effort need to be done to guide them through the 'get started' part.

It took **one month** to create the first version of the website. More details about the experience can be read [here](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/blog_20230717_teaching/).

### Adding `WebR` to the course

One year later, as technology advances, we added new content to some parts of the website. Most notably is the interactivity achieved through `WebR`. For example, I made this [page](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/lab/lab_distribution.html) on **randomness and statistical distribution** where students can interactively modify code chunks in a web browser.


## Quarto as a collaboration tool

A static (or even interactive) website is not exactly what you call 'collaborative tool'. However, if you work as a group towards **something cool**, Quarto might just be the tool you need. Check out the  [CAMIS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/) project to find out what I mean by this!
