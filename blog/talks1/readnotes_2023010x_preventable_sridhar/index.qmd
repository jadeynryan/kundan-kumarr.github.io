# Advice on some measures to prepare for the next pandemic

(*From [Five ways to prepare for the next pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03362-8) by Prof. Devi Sridhar*)

* Monitor zoonoses. Identify patogens with pandemic potential, regulate better wet markets
* Sequence globally. Investment in genetic-sequencing capability
* Strengthen manufacturing. Vaccine inequality, fragility of vaccine production. Private and public sector work together - vaccine research, production and distribution.
* Vaccine preparedness. For known diseases (e.g. influenza), invest in vaccines that protect against a wide range of variants. New technology and research for unknown threats
* Stop the spread (long enough for the vaccines) to save lives.
