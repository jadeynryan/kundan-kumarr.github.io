## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive framework to prepare for **Research Scientist positions** in academia, industry research labs (FAANG, OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.), and national labs. It combines insights from my own experience, interviews, and conversations with hiring managers.

## Key Interview Components

### 1. Research Portfolio Deep Dive

- Be able to explain your **core research contributions** clearly and concisely.
- Clearly define the problem, highlight novelty, describe methods, show results, and explain real-world relevance.
- Practice different versions of your explanation (5-min, 15-min, 30-min).
- Show awareness of how your work connects to broader trends and open challenges.

### 2. Technical Machine Learning Knowledge

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy gradients, actor-critic, safe RL, off-policy and on-policy methods.
- **Deep Learning**: Architecture design, optimization, transformers, generalization.
- **Statistical Learning**: Model selection, regularization (L1/L2), kernel methods, bias-variance tradeoff. ([See Notes](https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/statistics-analysis/))
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, latent variable models.
- **Generative Models**: GANs, VAEs, diffusion models.
- **Large Language Models**: Scaling laws, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, prompting, RAG architectures.
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, segmentation, multimodal learning.
- **Data Science Foundations**: Data pipelines, EDA, data cleaning, transformation. ([See Notes](https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/data-science/intro.html))

### 3. System Design / Applied ML Problems

- Understand how to build ML systems end-to-end:
  - Feature engineering and data preprocessing
  - Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and validation
  - Deployment (latency, scalability, monitoring)
  - Addressing data drift, noisy labels, and real-world constraints

### 4. Coding and Algorithmic Skills

- Moderate-level data structures and algorithms:
  - Arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming
- ML coding:
  - Data manipulation using pandas/numpy
  - Prototyping in PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX
  - Basic SQL queries and joins

### 5. Behavioral and Collaboration Skills

- Practice behavioral questions:
  - "Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict"
  - "How do you approach ambiguous research questions?"
- Demonstrate collaboration across disciplines and teams
- Emphasize your ability to communicate technical ideas to non-experts

## Recommended Preparation Resources

- **Key Papers**: NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL
- **Books**:
  - *Designing Machine Learning Systems* – Chip Huyen
  - *Deep Learning* – Ian Goodfellow
  - *The Elements of Statistical Learning* – Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
  - *Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning* – David Barber
- **Coding Practice**: Leetcode (focus on Medium problems)
- **System Design Practice**: ML interview prep platforms, YouTube walkthroughs
- **Mock Interviews**: Conduct with peers, mentors, or online platforms

## Example Interview Questions

- What are the main contributions of your most recent paper?
- How does your approach compare to existing methods?
- How would you adapt your method if data was scarce or noisy?
- What assumptions underlie your models, and how would you validate them?
- How do you handle uncertainty and interpretability?
- How would you apply your method to a new domain or product?

---

## Personal Advice

- Focus on clarity — aim to teach, not just impress.
- Keep your message grounded in the real-world impact of your work.
- Be honest about challenges or failures — show how you learned from them.
- Show excitement for the work and curiosity about new ideas.
- Practice regularly and iterate based on feedback.
