# Overview

This is a course provided by Genentech (part of Roche) on Coursera ([course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/making-data-science-work-for-clinical-reporting)). It is not necessary to have a paid coursera membership to view the course, everyone could access it.

It is a 4 part course released one month ago (Jan/Feb 2023), and it seems that a follow-up will be released in the future.

Overall I think it strikes a good balance between high-level introduction of the good practices, and examples with how they are implemented. Even though the course focuses on **clinical reporting in the pharmaceutical industry**, the practices are highly relevant in other sectors as well (e.g. public health, academia, other industries that use open-source software).

Specific statistical methods, packages are introduced only at a high-level; which means the course is not for learning how to use this or that packages; but good practice guidelines.

In my opinion, 

* it would be useful if the learner has some experience with software development and/or statistics; otherwise learners *might* not know how to practice them. 
* most of the examples are related to R packages (understandable), so some experience with R package (use or develop) is useful. 
* it could be a very good study material for university students in related subjects.

## Each module 

* Module 1 ([notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/technotes_20230205_clinreport_part1/)): what the requirements are regarding clinical reporting, what should be done to meet the quality standards;
* Module 2 ([notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/technotes_20230222_clinreport_part2/)): DevOps and Agile 
* Module 3 ([notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/technotes_20230222_clinreport_part2/)): version Control, git workflows, reproducible clinical reporting
* Module 4 ([notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/technotes_20230227_clinreport_part3/)): code quality, robust and reusable code, R packages
* Module 5 ([notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/blog/technotes_20230227_clinreport_part4/)): risk management with open source software


## Highlight

I have a few years of experience as an R developer and academic researcher in related fields, so not all concepts are new to me. Nevertheless, I still learned quite a bit. For example, 

* (Module 1) Data and results sharing needs to follow certain standards, such as **CDISC**; there are different industry standards to follow when it comes to data acquisition, tabulation and analysis (e.g. **ADaM**)
* (Module 2) Data scientists not only need hard skills, but also soft skills - they need to be able to wear many hats, and be more flexible and resilient.
* (Module 4, 5) **Tests** are extremely important. Think afar, develop your package so that they can be extended in the future. Design your package first, don't start making your package immediately.



# Ways forward as a practitioner

There are things I know I have started doing (like write function documentation and vignette, use small functions rather than large and long ones); yet there are lots of things I should be making an active effort on.

I have beenn using **CI/CD** "unconsciously": my team had been using it, GitHub Action builds my `pkgdown` website automatically; I've learned the basics of CI/CD and GitHub Actions at one occasion; and that is it. This should be done in a better and more consistent way. 

More careful **package planning** should be done; **tests** should definitely be prioritized in my future code. Use **object oriented** design so that I can extend the functionalities in the future.
