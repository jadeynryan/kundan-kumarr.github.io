  A workflow that worked for me: when you have a few vignette documents, and want to display them nicely in a website format.

# 1. Create the website skeleton.

Before editing the details, we need to create the skeleton for the website. It can be done with `usethis` and `pkgdown` packages.

In R, run this: 

```
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```
This creates the `_pkgdown.yml` file, which is the place you configure your site.


To view the initial package website, use the following command:
```
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This creates `docs/` directory containing a website

* `README.md` becomes the homepage,
* documentation in `man/` generates a function reference,
* vignettes are rendered into `articles/`.


# 2. Edit the vignette documentation

Make sure that the vignette index is consistent with **Title**, otherwise it will not render.

# 3. Build and preview your site

Now check if the site looks good, and contents are correctly positioned.

```
pkgdown::preview_site()
pkgdown::build_site()
```

You can also do this to build the site.

```
pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()
```

# 4. Deploy site with GitHub Pages

There seems to be two options: 

* `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`, this function should take care of everything after pushing changes to GH. 
* if you used `pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()` and pushed everything to GitHub, it might not automatically deploy your site to GH pages. I tried to go to *Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from a branch -> main -> /docs*, this makes Action deploy your site from the `docs` folder. 
  * double check if you have `.nojekyll` file
  * if a website does not show, check whether you have `docs` in the `.gitignore` file; since you are deploying from that folder.
