The [Soil Health Roadmap](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/roadmap/) is a science-based guide to maintaining and improving soil health in eight focus areas across Washington state.

For each focus area, I created crop and soil maps using the [`arcpy` Python package](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/importing-arcpy.htm). I then summarized the crop acreage and soil properties in interactive ArcGIS dashboards to complement the [117-page report](https://hk79fd.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WSU-Soil-Health-Roadmap-updated-August-2023_page.pdf).
