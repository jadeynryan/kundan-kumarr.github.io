# Deploy a shiny app 

## Considerations

A few ways to do it: **Shiny Server** (free), **shinyapps.io** (free and premium), and professional Rstudio Connect (paid). 

I choose to test out the second option, since it allows more possibilities compared to the free open-source Shiny Server.

The free option should allow me to create **5 apps**, which is more than enough for personal use. It also allows **25 active hours** per month; a note on that at the end.



## Configuration

Sign up with GitHub account; or something else. It is possible to change account name afterwards.

In Rstudio, 

* first `install.packages('rsconnect')`
* then, configure the account. It can be done with `rsconnect::setAccountInfo()` with information provided in your own **shinyapps.io** page.

Before the last step, it is necessary to have an app to deploy!

## Create my first shiny project

Here I use my usual workflow of creating a new R project: 

* Create a new repo on GitHub;
* Clone the repo locally, by opening a new R project with version control.

Now copy the two R scripts from the [demo example](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html?_ga=2.91218270.516609615.1677344806-1911681.1677344806):

* `server.R`
* `ui.R`

Test locally by running `shiny::runApp()`. This should render the app.

## Deploy to shinyapps.io

`rsconnect::deployApp()` will deploy the app, with an automatically generated url that links to your account.

The demo app is deployed [here](https://chizapoth.shinyapps.io/shinydev/). 


### Note on active hours

After deployment, the site seems to be active until you shut it down manually; or timeout. The default timeout is 15 minutes, which can be reduced to 5 minutes. 

25 hours per month suggests that I can open the site for 300 times (without manually shuting it down). It might be necessary to start using the paid options, if I have more than one site, or multiple users want to access it ...
